# Menu Creator - Front
---

This is the front part of the application to create a menu. Created for personal use and to develop skills in Angular and frontend technology like Bootstrap.
At the moment, the application is not ready yet and some of the code will change, because I used a Google firebase backend so far. Some logic will be transferred to my second part of the application which will be responsible for the backend.The backend part of application you can find [here](https://github.com/JaroslawCzerwinski/Menu-Creator-Back).
